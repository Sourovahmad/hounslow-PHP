                        <b>HMRC Photo Code Generation</b>
                        <p>When applying for a passport online, you need an HMRC code. This is a digital photo which you must use when applying for a passport online. The photo must have been taken within the last month and must meet certain rules to avoid rejection. At Royalproductphotography, we help generate the code that guarantees approval. So if you do not have the code, we can help generate one. You only need to upload your photo to our website and allow our team to work on it and generate your HMRC code. </p>
                        <p>You may take a photo using your smartphone. However, do not take the photo using a selfie. Thus, you must request for help and allow someone else to take the photo. </p>
                        <p>Once the photo is uploaded on our website, we will edit and adjust it before generating the HMRC code. We will send the code to your mail to enable you to apply for your passport online. </p>

                        <p>If the home office declines to issue a passport to you due to a rejected photo, we can help adjust the photo to meet the set guidelines. We will also resize the passport photos to guarantee approval. </p>
